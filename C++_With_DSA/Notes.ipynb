    "Here are some very basic but important things to remember while coding in C++:\n",
    "\n",
    "<hr>\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Use single quotes for `characters` and double quotes for `strings`.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Use `#include <iostream>` for input and output operations.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Use `std::cout` for output and `std::cin` for input.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Use `std::endl` to insert a new line.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Use `using namespace std;` to avoid typing `std::` before every standard library function.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. Use `#include <vector>` for using vectors.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. Use `#pragma once` at the top of header files to prevent multiple inclusions. Instead of using `#ifndef`, `#define`, and `#endif` directives.\n",
    "\n",
    "<hr>\n",
    "\n",
    "**Related to Functions**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. When defining function `parameters`, define the variables with reference `&` to avoid copying large data structures.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. If there's an `argument` that is not going to be modified, use `const` to ensure it remains unchanged.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. When we are passing a `reference` to a function, we can use `const` to ensure that the function does not modify the original data. i.e. `void func(const int &x)`.\n",
    "\n",
    "<hr>\n",
    "\n",
    "**Related to Memory Management**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. We always need to `delete` the memory allocated using `new` to avoid memory leaks. Any objects created with `new` allocated on the heap must be deleted using `delete`.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Use `delete[]` for arrays allocated with `new[]`.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Use `nullptr` to check if a pointer is not pointing to any memory location.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Whenever we create an object using `new` inside a class as below:\n",
    "\n",
    "```C++\n",
    "\n",
    "Inventory::Inventory() : capacity(10) // Default constructor\n",

    "  this->items = new vector<string>(); // The pointer is stored in the Stack, and Vector object is stored in the Heap\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The pointer `items` is stored in the Stack, and the actual `vector<string>` object is stored in the Heap. So, we need to delete the pointer in the `destructor` to avoid memory leaks.\n",

    "{\n",
    "  delete this->items; // Delete the vector to free memory\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Whenever we instiantiate a class with `new` keyword and use the `pointer` to store the object, we need to delete the pointer in the destructor to avoid memory leaks.\n",
    "\n",
    "Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "```C++\n",

    "Or,\n",
    "\n",
    "Instead use `smart pointers` like `std::unique_ptr` or `std::shared_ptr` to manage memory automatically and avoid manual memory management.\n",

    "2. Invert all bits (change 0s to 1s and 1s to 0s).\n",

    "\n",
    "If we apply the left shift operator on this number, it will shift all bits to the left, filling the rightmost bits with zeros.\n",

    "So, if we apply the left shift operator on `-2` by `1` position, it will become `11111100` (in 8 bits) or `11111111 11111111 11111111 11111100` (in 32 bits) which is equivalent to `-4`.\n",

    "But sometimes, the left shift operator can lead to unexpected results when applied to negative numbers. This is because the leftmost bit is used to represent the sign of the number, and shifting it can change the sign of the number.\n",

    "In this example, we have an `int8_t` variable `x` with a value of `64`. The `int8_t` data type is an 8-bit signed integer, which means it can represent values from `-128` to `127`.\n",
    "\n",
    "The binary representation of `64` is `01000000`, the `MSB` (Most Significant Bit) is `0` means it is a positive number.

    "**Ownership** is a fundamental concept in C++ that refers to the responsibility of managing the lifetime of an object in memory. In C++, when we create an object, we are responsible for ensuring that it is properly deallocated when it is no longer needed. This is where smart pointers come into play.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Garbage Collection** is a mechanism that automatically manages memory by reclaiming memory that is no longer in use. C++ does not have built-in garbage collection like some other languages (e.g., Java, Python), so we need to manage memory manually using smart pointers.\n",
    "\n",
    "In C++, the closest alternative to garbage collection is the use of `smart` `pointers` like `std::unique_ptr`, `std::shared_ptr`, and `std::weak_ptr` provided by the Standard Library. `Smart` `pointers` manage object lifetimes automatically and ensure that memory is released when it is no longer needed. This provides a more robust and safer way to handle dynamic memory in C++ without requiring explicit calls to delete by the programmer, thus reducing the risk of memory leaks and dangling pointers.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Example of Smart Pointer**\n",
    "\n",
    "```C++\n",
    "\n",
    "#include <iostream>\n",

    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In the above code, we have used `std::unique_ptr` to create a smart pointer that manages the memory of an `Enemy` object. The `make_unique` function is used to create a new `Enemy` object and return a `std::unique_ptr` that owns it. When the `std::unique_ptr` goes out of scope, it automatically deallocates the memory for the `Enemy` object, preventing memory leaks.\n"

    "<hr>\n",
    "\n",
    "Pointers are essential in C++ for several reasons:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Dynamic Memory Allocation**: Pointers allow for dynamic memory allocation using `new` and `delete`, enabling the creation of data structures like linked lists, trees, and graphs.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Access Dynamic Memory**: Pointers provide a way to access and manipulate memory directly, which is crucial for performance-critical applications.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Pass by Reference**: Pointers enable passing large data structures to functions without copying them, improving performance and memory usage.\n",

    "4. **Implement Complex Data Structures**: Pointers are used to implement complex data structures like linked lists, trees, and graphs, which require dynamic memory management.\n",
    "\n",

    "Many types of memory can be created and used by default when we write and run a C++ program.\n",

    "It is very important to understand how memory is allocated and deallocated in C++ to avoid memory leaks and other issues.\n",
    "\n",
    "Also, how the data types or variables are stored in different memory type.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Have you ever wondered what is the different between using `static` keyword and not using it?**\n",

    "\n",
    "<hr>\n",
    "\n",
    "Before moving forward, we need to understand different memory segments in C++.\n",
    "\n",
    "Whenever we run a C++ program, the compiler allocates memory for different segments of the program. These segments are:\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Text Segment**\n",
    "\n",
    "This segment contains the compiled code of the program. It is read-only and cannot be modified during runtime.\n",
    "\n",
    "The text segment is where the actual code of the program resides. It is typically stored in a read-only section of memory, which means that it cannot be modified during runtime. This helps to prevent accidental modification of the code and ensures that the program behaves as expected.\n",

    "For default, constructor, we do not pass any parameters. It initializes the data members to default values (0 for integers, empty string for strings, etc.).\n",

    "An interface is a contract that defines a set of methods that a class must implement. In `C++`, we can create an interface using pure virtual functions.

    "## **Compiler Tool Chain (Code Compilation Process)**\n",
    "\n",
    "The compiler tool chain is a set of tools that are used to compile and link C++ programs. It consists of several stages, each responsible for a specific task in the compilation process.\n",
    "\n",
    "<hr>\n",
    "\n",
    "The compilation process can be divided into the following stages:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Preprocessing**: The preprocessor handles directives like `#include`, `#define`, and `#ifdef`. It processes the source code before actual compilation, expanding macros and including header files.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Compilation**: The compiler translates the preprocessed source code into `assembly language`. It performs syntax checking, type checking, and generates intermediate code.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Assembly**: The assembler converts the assembly code generated by the compiler into machine code `(object code)`. This is a low-level representation of the program that can be executed by the CPU.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Linking**: The linker combines multiple object files and libraries into a single executable file. It resolves references between different object files and libraries, ensuring that all symbols are correctly linked.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. **Loading**: The loader loads the executable file into memory and prepares it for execution. It sets up the program's memory layout, including the stack, heap, and data segments.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. **Execution**: The operating system executes the loaded program, starting from the `main` function.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Compiler Tool Chain Example**\n",
    "\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "# Preprocessing\n",
    "g++ -E main.cpp -o main.i\n",

    "## **Operator Overloading**\n",
    "\n",
    "Operator overloading is a feature in C++ that allows us to define custom behavior for operators when applied to user-defined types (classes). This enables us to use operators like `+`, `-`, `*`, `[]`, `==`, etc., with objects of our classes, making the code more intuitive and readable.\n",
    "\n",
    "To `overload` an operator, we define a member function or a friend function in the class that specifies how the operator should behave for objects of that class. The function must have a specific signature, depending on whether it is a member function or a friend function.\n",
    "\n",
    "<hr>\n",
    "\n",
    "**Important Things to Consider While Using Operator Overloading**\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The overloaded operator should always return a new object or a reference to the current object, depending on the operator being overloaded. Example `return *this;` for unary operators or `return Inventory(*this);` for binary operators.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. The operator should not change the state of the operands unless it is a compound assignment operator (like `+=`, `-=`, etc.).\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Operators can be `uniary` (like `++`, `--`, `!`, `+=`) or `binary` (like `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`). Unary operators take one operand, while binary operators take two operands or `ternary` (like `? :`) take 3 operands.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. We need to use `operator` keyword followed by the operator symbol to define the overloaded operator function. For example, instead of `addItem`, we can use `Inventory &operator+=(const string &item)` to overload the `+=` operator for adding items to the inventory.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Implementation of Operator Overloading**\n",
    "\n",
    "In our `Inventory` class, we have used methods like `getItem`, `addItem`, and `removeItem` to manipulate the items in the inventory. We can also overload operators to make the code more intuitive.\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "// Add elements\n",
    "myInventory += \"Birat\"; // Using overloaded += operator\n",
    "myInventory += \"Biratt\";\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "When we use `myInventory += \"Birat\";`, the compiler translates this into a call to the `operator+=(\"Birat\")` function of the `Inventory` class.\n",
    "\n",
    "The argument `\"Birat\"` is passed to the function and `item` points to the passed parameter, and the function checks if the current size of the `items` vector is less than the `capacity`. If it is, it adds the item to the vector using `push_back`. If not, it prints an error message.\n",
    "\n",
    "And, returns `*this`, which is a reference i.e. address to the current object, but here we have not captured it so the two lines that calls the overloaded operator will not have any effect on the `myInventory` object. They are called independently in the stack. Still we need to return `*this` to allow chaining of operations.\n",

    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The above will not work because the excution will start from the left hand side, and `Sword` is a string literal i.e. `const char[6]`, and it does not have the `+=` operator overloaded. Therefore, the compiler will throw an error.\n",

    "So we need to make it a string object like this:\n",

    "```C++\n",
    "myInventory += \"Sword\" += std::string(\"Shield\") += \"Potion\";\n",

    "## **Inheritance**\n",
    "\n",
    "Inheritance is a fundamental concept in object-oriented programming (OOP) that allows us to create new classes based on existing classes. The new class, called the derived class or child class, inherits properties and behaviors from the existing class, called the base class or parent class. This promotes code reuse and establishes a hierarchical relationship between classes.\n",
    "\n",
    "`Base Class` is the class from which properties and methods are inherited, while `Derived Class` is the class that inherits properties and methods from the base class.\n",
    "\n",
    "Inheritance Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "```C++\n",
    "class Weapon : public Item {\n",
    "  // Weapon specific properties and methods\n",
    "};\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Keywords in Inheritance**\n",
    "\n",
    "**virtual**: This keyword is used to declare a method in the base class that can be overridden in the derived class. It allows for dynamic polymorphism, enabling the program to decide at runtime which method to call based on the actual object type.\n",
    "\n",
    "**protected**: This access modifier allows members (variables and methods) to be accessible within the class itself and by derived classes. It is more restrictive than `public` but less restrictive than `private`.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Inheritance Notes**\n",
    "\n",
    "If we've a `virtual` descriptor in the base class, then when we `delete` a pointer object of the derived class then the destructor of the base class will be called and it will clear the whole memory allocated for the derived class object, preventing memory leaks.\n",

    "## **Polymorphism**\n",
    "\n",
    "`Polymorphism` allows us to use a single `interface` to represent different underlying data types. In C++, `polymorphism` is mainly achieved through `virtual` functions. When a base class declares a function as `virtual`, the derived classes can override this function to provide specific behavior, and the correct function is called at runtime based on the actual object type.\n",
    "\n",
    "Overriding a function means providing a new implementation for a base class function within a derived class.\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Keywords in Polymorphism**\n",
    "\n",
    "We use the `virtual` keyword to declare a function in the base class that can be overridden in derived classes. This allows for dynamic binding, where the function to be called is determined at runtime based on the actual object type.\n",
    "\n",
    "To actually override a function in a derived class, we use the `override` keyword. This is optional but recommended as it helps catch errors if the function signature does not match the base class function.\n",

    "Example of Polymorphism:\n",
    "\n",
    "```C++\n",
