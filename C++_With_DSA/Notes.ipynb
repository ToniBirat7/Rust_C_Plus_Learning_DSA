    "The left shift operator `<<` shifts the bits of a number to the left by a specified number of positions. Each left shift effectively multiplies the number by 2.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, if we are storing a number (8 bits) in a variable and we apply the left shift operator, it will move all bits to the left, filling the rightmost bits with zeros.\n",

    "We know that to store a negative number, we will need to use the `signed` data type. The leftmost bit will be used to represent the sign of the number i.e. `0 for positive` and `1 for negative`.\n",
    "\n",
    "When we use `int x = -2` it is stored in the memory as `11111110` (in 8 bits) or `11111111 11111111 11111111 11111110` (in 32 bits) i.e. two's complement representation of -2.\n",

    "2. Invert all bits (change 0s to 1s and 1s to 0s).\n",
    "3. Add 1 to the inverted binary number.\n",
    "\n",
    "This results in the binary representation of the negative number.\n",

    "\n",
    "If we apply the left shift operator on this number, it will shift all bits to the left, filling the rightmost bits with zeros.\n",

    "So, if we apply the left shift operator on `-2` by `1` position, it will become `11111100` (in 8 bits) or `11111111 11111111 11111111 11111100` (in 32 bits) which is equivalent to `-4`.\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "But sometimes, the left shift operator can lead to unexpected results when applied to negative numbers. This is because the leftmost bit is used to represent the sign of the number, and shifting it can change the sign of the number.\n",

    "// x: 64\n",
    "// x << 1: -128\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, we have an `int8_t` variable `x` with a value of `64`. The `int8_t` data type is an 8-bit signed integer, which means it can represent values from `-128` to `127`.\n",
    "\n",
    "The binary representation of `64` is `01000000`, the `MSB` (Most Significant Bit) is `0` means it is a positive number. When we apply the left shift operator `<<` to `x`, it shifts the bits to the left by one position, resulting in `10000000`, which is the binary representation of `-128` in two's complement form.\n",

    "This code example demonstrates how the left shift operator can change the sign of a negative number, leading to unexpected results.\n",
    "\n",
    "Also, this example teaches us that we should carefully choose the data type we use for our variables, especially when dealing with bitwise operations. Using a signed data type can lead to unexpected results when using the left shift operator, as it can change the sign of the number.\n",

    "\n",
    "**Constants**, on the other hand, are variables that cannot be changed after they are defined. They are defined using the `const` keyword and have a specific data type. Constants are type-safe and can be used in expressions just like regular variables. They are evaluated at runtime and can be used in expressions that require a specific data type.\n",

    "- Use **constants** when you need to define variables that cannot be changed after they are defined, and when you need type safety and compile-time checking.
